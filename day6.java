//problem

/*You are given an array of integers arr[]. Your task is to reverse the given array.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 1 4 3 2 6 5. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is 5 6 2 3 4 1.
Input: arr = [4, 5, 2]
Output: [2, 5, 4]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 4 5 2. The reversed array will be 2 5 4.
Input: arr = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.
Constraints:
1<=arr.size()<=105
0<=arr[i]<=105
*/
//Solution:
class Solution {
    public void reverseArray(int arr[]) {
        // code here
        int front=0;
        int back=arr.length - 1;
        while(front<=back){
            int temp = arr[front];
            arr[front]=arr[back];
            arr[back]=temp;
            front++;
            back--;
        }
    }
}
